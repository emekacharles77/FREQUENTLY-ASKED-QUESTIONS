            <h2>What is the use of Webkit in CSS3?</h2>
            <p>Webkit is a rendering engine used in CSS3 to display HTML and CSS elements on various web browsers, including Chrome, Safari, and earlier versions of Opera. It provides the necessary functionality for rendering web content and ensuring consistency across different platforms. It is important to note that Webkit is just one of several browser engines, with others including Gecko (used by Mozilla Firefox), Presto (used by older versions of Opera), and EdgeHTML (used by Microsoft Edge prior to its switch to Chromium).</p>

            <h2>What are the uses of child selectors in CSS?</h2>
            <p>Child selectors in CSS are powerful tools for targeting specific elements that are direct children of another element. They are denoted by the “greater than” symbol (>) and allow developers to apply styles or perform actions exclusively on immediate child elements.
                Child selectors are useful for creating refined and granular styles, controlling the appearance of specific child elements within a parent container, and achieving more precise CSS targeting.</p>

            <h2>How does CSS3 help in implementing rounded borders easily?</h2>
            <p>CSS3 has the <border-radius> property that allows elements to be created with nice-looking rounded corners. This can easily be applied to all four sides or as per requirement.</p>

            <h2>How is type conversion handled in JavaScript?</h2>
            <p>JavaScript supports automatic type conversion. Since it is weakly typed, you can pass a function as an argument into another function easily.
                This ensures that there are no errors or data type-associated warnings as values get converted to the required data type automatically.</p>

            <h2>What is the result if a jQuery Event Handler returns false?</h2>
            <p>If a jQuery event handler returns false, it prevents the default behavior of the event and stops the event from propagating further. This can be used to cancel actions like form submission or link navigation when certain conditions are not met.</p>
